# lossycompression
Error-controlled lossy compressors
Evaluated naive prediction methods and tested simple variants: 1D/2D/3D Lorenzo predictors 
Applied spline predictors. Studied trade-off between sampling distance and compression efficiency 
while uniformly sampling data points from original data and using splines to predict missing data.
